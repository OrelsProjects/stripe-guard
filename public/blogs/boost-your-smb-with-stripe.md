## Common Payment Processing Challenges for SMBs

1. **High Transaction Fees**: Traditional processors charge fees that erode profits. For SMBs operating on slim margins, this can significantly impact growth potential.
2. **Limited Subscription Management**: Manual subscription management can lead to billing errors, failed renewals, and frustrated customers.
3. **Fraud Risks**: SMBs face heightened vulnerability to fraudulent transactions due to limited resources to implement robust fraud prevention.
4. **Inefficient Reporting**: Without detailed analytics, it becomes challenging to make informed financial and operational decisions.

These challenges can seem overwhelming, but Stripe provides a comprehensive toolkit to address them effectively.
