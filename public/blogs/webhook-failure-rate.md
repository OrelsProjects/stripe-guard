# Why Every Webhook Failure Matters (And How You Can Prevent It)

Webhooks are the lifeblood of modern businesses. Whether it’s confirming a payment, updating a subscription, or triggering a critical action in your app, webhooks ensure your operations run smoothly. But what happens when a webhook fails?

## Shopify’s Benchmark: 1 in 200 Webhooks Will Fail

According to Shopify’s standards, a failure rate of **0.5%** (1 in every 200 webhooks) is considered good for a well-implemented system ([source](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/troubleshooting-webhooks)). But even with this "acceptable" failure rate, let’s look at the real-world impact:

- Imagine your **customer lifetime value (LTV)** is **$50**.
- For every 200 webhooks, you risk losing one customer entirely due to a failure—a missed payment, an unprocessed subscription renewal, or a critical event notification.
- That’s $50 in lost revenue per 200 webhook events. Worse, it doesn’t account for the potential damage to your brand if an unhappy customer decides to share their frustration publicly.

## The Real-Life Impact of Webhook Failures

In reality, a 0.5% failure rate can mean:

1. **Missed Payments**: A failed webhook could mean a customer’s payment doesn’t get processed, leading to subscription cancellations or service disruptions.  
2. **Lost Trust**: Customers expect smooth and seamless experiences. A single glitch could erode their trust in your brand.  
3. **Churn Amplification**: If a customer leaves due to a webhook failure, they may also discourage others from using your service, amplifying the loss.

## How to Improve Your Webhook Success Rate

Improving your webhook reliability doesn’t have to be rocket science. Here are actionable steps:

1. **Enable Retries**: Many platforms, including Stripe, provide built-in retry mechanisms. Leverage these to handle transient failures.  
2. **Log and Monitor**: Set up logging for webhook events. Monitoring tools can help you catch and fix issues before they snowball.  
3. **Use Reliable Infrastructure**: Host your webhook endpoints on reliable platforms like AWS, Vercel, or DigitalOcean to minimize downtime.  
4. **Implement Alerts**: Use tools that notify you immediately when a webhook fails, so you can take action before customers are affected.  
5. **Test and Validate**: Regularly test your webhooks for payload parsing errors, authentication issues, and endpoint reachability.
